# ImageCaption

General: In this reconstruction I chose to use a Machine Learning model to give the description of the input image.

## Two Image Caption ways:
1. Using HuggingFace as off-the-shelf models. 
2. Create and Trained model form scrath.


## The steps logic steps of way (2):

- Extract features from image by pre-trained model.
- Decode the extract features to tokens by LSTM model.
- Convert the tokes to words based on dataset vocabliray.

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [HuggingFace] - Using this off-the-shelf models API.
- [Torch] - ML library.
- [inception_v3] - For extracting features.
- [LSTM] - For decoding the features.

## Installation
